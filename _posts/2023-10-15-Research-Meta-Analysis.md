In response to the prompt assigned to me, I analyzed a scientific report about emotional content's impact on gaze inhibition in social situations and answered the questions. 

## Question One
**What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in gaze behavior between the social and non-social conditions, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in gaze behavior between the social and non-social conditions. 


## Question Two
**Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**

The authors of the study collected and analyzed the data. The text does not provide information on whether the authors had any assistance in collecting or analyzing the data.

## Question Three
**What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**

The study does not reference or use any external datasets. The data collected for this study is publicly available, [here](https://osf.io/wznfj/). The authors collected their own data using eye-tracking technology and analyzed it using statistical software.
