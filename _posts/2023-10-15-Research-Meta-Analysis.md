In response to the prompt assigned to me, I analyzed a scientific report about emotional content's impact on gaze tendencies in social situations and answered the questions. 

## Question One
**What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in gaze behavior between the social and non-social conditions, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in gaze behavior between the social and non-social conditions. 


## Question Two
**Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**

The authors of the study collected and analyzed the data. The text does not provide information on whether the authors had any assistance in collecting or analyzing the data.

## Question Three
**What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**

The study does not reference or use any external datasets. The data collected for this study is publicly available, [here](https://osf.io/wznfj/). The authors collected their own data using eye-tracking technology and analyzed it using statistical software.

## Question Four
**Why are they interested in this data?**

The researchers were interested in investigating how emotional expressions influence gaze behavior in social and non-social situations. The text explains that previous research has shown that social norms can influence gaze behavior, but it is not clear how emotional expressions might interact with these norms. The authors were interested in exploring this relationship.

## Question Five
**What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?**

The study recorded participants' gaze behavior using eye-tracking technology. The text does not provide information on what data might be left out. However, the authors do discuss some limitations of their study, such as the fact that they only used one confederate and one set of emotional expressions.


## Question Six 
**What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?**

To support their conclusions the authors presented analyses and p-values. For example,  they employed a mixed effects model to examine how emotional expressions affect gaze behavior and found differences between conditions. They also discussed the implications of their findings in relation to research that suggests social norms can influence how we look at others.

## Question Seven
**How was this study funded?**

The study was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

## Question Eight
**Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?**

It is worth considering that this study may have been influenced by "publish or perish" pressures due to advances in technology and increased interactions, through social media platforms. However, it remains unclear how social norms and emotional expressions come into play within these environments. Through the examination of gaze patterns, in real-life situations, the researchers were able to uncover insights into responses to emotional expressions during interpersonal interactions. These findings could potentially enhance our understanding of dynamics in environments.
