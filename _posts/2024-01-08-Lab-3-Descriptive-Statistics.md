## One:
For this lab I used Basketball Reference to access Michael Jordan's and Lebron James' career statistics. 
[This is a link to Michael Jordan's stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html#per_game), and [this is a link to Lebron James'](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#per_game)

## Two:
{: .box-warning}I chose not to use advanced stats as many of them are really incomparable as the two players played in very different eras, and had very different roles on their team. As well as the fact that many advanced stats use speculation with no gurantee. 


Basketball Reference had alot of statistics on both players but the majority of the data is mostly irrelevant, and not talked about when typically comparing the players. So for my study I only choose: points, assists, offensive rebounds, field goal percent, defensive rebounds, steals, and blocks. I selected these as it was most representative of the two players defnsive and offensive capabilities. 

From these datasets I hope to be able to ascertain which player is more consistent in every category, as well as who had the higher peak. 

## Three:
For every category I found that a boxplot was the best way to represent the two's careers in the categories. 

**Points**

The data shows that throughout the two's careers Michael Jordan averaged a signficantly higher points per game. But what is not shown in the graph is that at the end of his career when he was on the wizards he had a steep fall off, while LeBron throughout his entire career has only increased since his rookie season with little sign of slowing down despite entering year 21. 

**Assists**

The data shows that LeBron has averaged a much higher assist per game. This is the first example of a statistic not telling the full story as it was simply never Jordan's role on any team to be the team's primary passer as he was literally a scorer. As well as the fact that despite LeBron being larger he has had years where he plays the point guard, where assists would become a much larger focus than it normally would than if he was playing his normal small forward position.

**Field Goal Percent**
