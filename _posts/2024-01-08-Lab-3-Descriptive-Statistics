## One:
For this lab I used Basketball Reference to access Michael Jordan's and Lebron James' career statistics. 
[This is a link to Michael Jordan's stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html#per_game), and [this is a link to Lebron James'](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html#per_game)

## Two:
{: .box-warning}
I chose not to use advanced stats as many of them are really incomparable as the two players played in very different eras, and had very different roles on their team. As well as the fact that many advanced stats use speculation with no gurantee. 

Basketball Reference had alot of statistics on both players but the majority of the data is mostly irrelevant, and not talked about when typically comparing the players. So for my study I only choose: points, assists, offensive rebounds, field goal percent, defensive rebounds, steals, and blocks. I selected these as it was most representative of the two players defnsive and offensive capabilities. 

From these datasets I hope to be able to ascertain which player is more consistent in every category, as well as who had the higher peak. 

## Three:
For every category I found that a boxplot was the best way to represent the two's careers in the categories.
